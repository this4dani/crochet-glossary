        <h2>From 8-Year-Old Beginner to Pattern Problem Solver</h2>
        <p>
          I started crocheting at 8 years old, and after <span class="story-highlight">30 years of experience</span>, 
          I thought I'd mastered everything. But one frustration kept haunting me: spending hours 
          rewriting entire patterns just to make simple adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tech journey began in middle school when a teacher introduced me to computers. 
          <span class="story-highlight">MySpace HTML became my obsession</span> - I had to have the coolest page, 
          which meant learning hex codes and web design. Little did I know this would lead to solving 
          crochet problems decades later.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an office manager in ministry, I serve church communities with both hands-on and technology solutions. 
          <span class="story-highlight">Life is a hot mess, but I have Joy in the Lord</span> - and I'm determined 
          to build tools that help fellow crocheters spend more time creating and less time calculating.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            After 30 years of crocheting, I still spend hours rewriting patterns for simple adjustments. 
            Different yarn weight? Rewrite everything. Gauge slightly off? Start from scratch.

        <div class="mission-card">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I'm building a pattern adjustment API that automates the math, so crocheters can focus 
            on creating instead of calculating. Because our time should be spent making beautiful things.
